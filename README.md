# Deprecated
The chatbot abstraction library called "maubot" was deprecated and replaced with [a plugin-based Matrix bot system](https://github.com/maubot/maubot), so this bot was also replaced. You can find the new version at [maubot/jesaribot](https://github.com/maubot/jesaribot)

# Jesaribot
This is a very simple [Maubot](https://github.com/tulir/maubot-legacy) example.

## Running
1. Get a Telegram or Slack bot token.
2. Get this package with `go get -u maunium.net/go/maubot`
3. Figure out how to give the tokens to this bot (pro tip: `jesaribot --help`)
